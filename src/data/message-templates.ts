Thanks for your interest in working together! I'd love to learn a bit more about your content and audience to see how we might collaborate.

A few quick questions:
â€¢ What's your typical engagement rate?
â€¢ Do you currently work with other brands?
â€¢ What type of partnership interests you most?

Our app helps people organize their tasks, set goals, and stay focused. We typically offer both commission-based partnerships and flat-rate collaborations depending on the creator's preference.

Looking forward to hearing more about your work! ðŸŒŸ`,

Our partnership rates vary based on several factors like audience size, engagement, and content type. We work with both commission-based partnerships (typically 15-25%) and flat-rate collaborations ($X-$Y range).

I'd love to connect you directly with our partnerships team who can give you specific details based on your profile and preferences. They'll be able to discuss exact rates and terms.

Should I have them reach out to you directly? They're much better with the specifics than I am! ðŸ˜Š`,

We're particularly focused on entrepreneurs and busy professionals who need to juggle multiple projects and priorities.
